Bad fantomongo
==============
Fixed ObjectId:
 - ObjectId had no notion of pid

Fixed BsonReader:
 - BSON Timestamps were incorrectly converted to Fantom DateTime objects
 - BSON strings could not be read if they contain non-ASCII characters (byte vs char issue) 
 - Reading unsigned Ints when they should be signed Ints
 - Reading Regex's messed up the bytes read count -> warning
 - Reading Binary types lost the subtype
 - No support for BSON CODE

Fixed BsonWriter:
 - No support for BSON CODE
 - Incorrect length written for non-ASCII strings (byte vs char issue)

Had no Timestamp obj
Only ObjectId was Fantom serialisable
